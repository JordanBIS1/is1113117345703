        <br></br> Gaelic football has been a comstant in my life since the age of 6. Winning numerous county medals at underage level and making my Senior Championship Debut with Ballincollig aginst CIT in 2016 have been the highlights. Gaelic Football has given me invaluable insights into the mental strength, hard work and dedication it takes to be succesful.
